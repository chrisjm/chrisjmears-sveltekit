## Why Statistics Donâ€™t Capture the Full Extent of the Systemic Bias in Policing ðŸš¨

An insightful article by FiveThirtyEight, which goes through why we donâ€™t have enough data to properly analyze the bias of policing because we donâ€™t have the data on the individual bias from the police officer. In other words, a police officer has full control over who they approach, but they donâ€™t report on who they do not contact.

## Visualizing Statistics with Seeing Theory ðŸ“Š

Iâ€™ve been going deep into statistics and probability in my Bootcamp studies. Instead of only learning formulas, Iâ€™m focusing on understanding the mental models. Brown University has put together beautiful and very useful visualizations and demonstrations of fundamental statistical and probability theory.

## Corona Data Scraper ðŸ¦ 

If youâ€™re looking for COVID-19 data, this seems like the best source. It scrapes data from verified sources and links to some useful visualizations.

## Google Colab Tips for Power Users ðŸš€

These are some good useful tips for those who like to use Google Collaboratory for their notebooks. Tip #14 is pretty rad for pandas users.
