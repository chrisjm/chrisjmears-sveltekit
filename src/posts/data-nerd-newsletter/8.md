## DrawSQL: Database schema templates

`#sql` `#schemas`

Call me a data nerd, but I love me some database schema visualizations. While some diagramming apps are overly complicated or generalized, DrawSQL has an excellent interface and a public repository of schemas from some of the most popular open-source projects. It‚Äôs worth checking out even just to see how others are scheming. (sorry, I couldn‚Äôt help myself ü§™)

## Falcon by plotly: SQL editor with inline data visualization

`#sql` `#data-visualization`

Graphical SQL editors are useful when you just want to click around to get some quick database querying and analysis done. Falcon by plotly takes this a step further by adding inline data visualization directly into the interface. The best part is that it‚Äôs open-source, cross-platform, and free!

## HOWTO: Notebooks in Visual Studio Code

`#python` `#tutorial`

Jupyter notebooks have become the defacto for showing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling in an easy-to-read, linear format. But, sometimes, you want to do some quick analysis without spinning up a Jupyter notebook. If you‚Äôre already familiar with using VS Code as your development environment, this walkthrough will guide you on setting things up with Python Interactive.

## SQLPD: Learn SQL while solving crimes

`#sql` `#tutorial`

I‚Äôm a fan of game-based learning systems. Seriously, any little bit of dopamine to assist with learning mundane things is a big win in my book. SQL Police Department hops on the true-crime bandwagon to get you working through cases to solve crimes using SQL to query databases. It‚Äôs a work in progress and currently only contains basic SQL querying and filtering, but shows some promise.

## COVID-19 News & Dashboards

I haven‚Äôt seen much other new COVID-19 data news. I‚Äôm going to keep these dashboards readily available so we can track things since some states have decided to withdraw shelter-in-place restrictions. Stay safe out there!
