## üí∏ What are data brokers?

Data brokers are legitimate companies whose business is to collect and sell personal information. There are three main types of data brokers: people searching (private information), marketing (customer segmentation), and risk management (verify identity, fraud detection).

## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Why care?

While collecting data is not inherently bad, you should know how much information about you is circulating in the wild and passed through different channels without your knowledge. Some of these data brokers are why the GDPR was put in place by the EU and why you now blindly click "I Understand" on most websites these days.

The above infographic was created by Cracked Labs, a research institute based in Vienna. It shows with uncomfortable detail how much data is being collected and inferred by your online activities.

It's also worth noting that sometimes this information is entirely incorrect and could negatively impact job prospects or loan applications. Additionally, like with credit report companies, you may have to pay to search and verify your information.

## üì• How is my information collected?

While most of the information is obtained through public records, some data is clearly acquired and inferred by monitoring online activity.

Companies gather data by placing a tracking code on a website or purchasing analytics data from an ethically-malleable company. Cambridge Analytica is a well-known example of using the information it acquired from Facebook to [allegedly influence the 2016 election](https://towardsdatascience.com/effect-of-cambridge-analyticas-facebook-ads-on-the-2016-us-presidential-election-dacb5462155d).
