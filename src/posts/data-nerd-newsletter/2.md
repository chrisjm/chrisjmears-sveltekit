## Deep Learning Algorithms - The Complete Guide

`#deep-learning`

This highly approachable article describes each deep learning algorithm with understandable language and easy-to-digest diagrams.

That said, with AutoML-Zero mentioned in the [previous newsletter](/data-nerd-newsletter/1), perhaps knowing what these are and do will be moot once our robot overlords require us for more ‚Äúhuman‚Äù tasks. üòÜ

## dstack.ai: Collaborative data exploration

`#data-visualization`

This new collaborative service allows data scientists and analysts to push data visualizations via Python and R so that others can see and comment on the results. It‚Äôs also able to track revisions and is currently free for any public stacks. Here are some cool examples:

- [Life expectancy based on number of children (1964-2012)](https://dstack.ai/cheptsov/gapminder)
- [Confirmed COVID-19 cases by date and country](https://dstack.ai/cheptsov/covid19/speed_by_country)

The service is still relatively new but shows a lot of promise.

## COVID-19

Since the COV-19 pandemic is still very much in our collective attention (and possibly even ramping up), I‚Äôm going to keep this callout going. The more data we share about this outbreak, the better future generations will be prepared.

[COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research) - A public dataset of over 44,000 scholarly articles, including over 29,000 with full text, about COVID-19, and the coronavirus family of viruses for use by the global research community.

[Covidify: Python COVID-19 Data Analysis](https://github.com/AaronWard/covid-19-analysis) - This daily updated repository has datasets and tools which will extract the latest data and generate reports.

[COVID-19 Dashboard](https://ncov2019.live/) - Yet another dashboard, but this one was created by a teenager from Washington State, [Avi Schiffmann](https://twitter.com/AviSchiffmann).
