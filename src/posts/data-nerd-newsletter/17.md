## What to consider when visualizing data for colorblind readers 🎨

This article is part 2 of a 3-part series on colorblindness. It’s impressively thorough with explanations and charts to show how people with different types of colorblindness see the world and how to present better data visualizations.

## Discussion: Shout Out to All the Mediocre Data Scientists Out There 🙌

As a current student, I look forward to the day when I can level-up from an ignorant data science student to a mediocre data scientist. All joking aside, all levels deserve appreciation for the time and commitment they have put into their craft. If you’re also a student or mediocre data scientist, this discussion may be good motivation to keep on keepin’ on.

## CDC COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data 🦠

This public use dataset released by the CDC includes 1.75 million de-identified patients. While the data doesn’t contain any geographic information, it does have some relevant dates, age group information, ethnicity, and gender, which may help run through some machine learning algorithms.

## COVID-19 Dashboards

As expected, things are getting worse. Now that the U.S. executive branch decided to take over hospital data collection, I predict COVID data might become more unreliable and manipulated than it already is (looking at you, Florida). Even if there isn’t any malicious intent, changing complicated workflows during a crisis rarely works out for the better.

Wear a mask. Wash your hands. Stay safe out there!
