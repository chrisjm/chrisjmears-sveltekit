## Rt.live: Track how fast COVID-19 is spreading in the US

`#covid` `#dashboard`

The Instagram founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, have launched this project to track how fast COVID-19 is spreading in each US state.

‚ÄúRt‚Äù measures the average number of people who become infected by an infectious person. Therefore, the higher above 1.0, the faster COVID-19 is spreading, while a value below one indicates the virus is receding.

## Senate Stock Watcher

`#finance` `#dashboard`

As US lawmakers learned of the upcoming pandemic and before they announced it to the public, some decided it was a good time to sell off large amounts of stock. [Tim Carambat (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/tcarambat) built a pipeline and dashboard to help make these kinds of trades by politicians more transparent.

## Dive into Deep Learning: Interactive Textbook

`#deep-learning` `#tutorial`

I haven‚Äôt dived into it yet (hah!), but this interactive in-depth learning textbook looks really cool. It utilizes code, math, and discussions to help solidify complex deep learning concepts.

## COVID-19 News & Dashboards

Other than the Rt.live release, I haven‚Äôt seen much other new COVID-19 news. I‚Äôm going to keep these dashboards readily available so we can track things since some states have decided to withdraw shelter-in-place restrictions. Stay safe out there!
