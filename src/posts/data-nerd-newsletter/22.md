## Data Scientists Should Be More End-to-End 🔬

Written as an unpopular opinion, Eugene Yan discusses why he thinks data scientists should be more like full-stack software engineers. While I agree with some points, I’m also of the opinion that he describes the typical unicorn 🦄 worker every business wants.

## Announcing the new Jupyter Book 📕

The same non-profit organization that brought the widely popular Jupyter notebooks comes “an open source project for building beautiful, publication-quality books, websites, and documents from source material that contains computational content.” It even looks like you can easily host via static web hosts like Github. Sign me up!

## danfo.js: Data analysis library based on Pandas 🐼

The JavaScript data science libraries are starting to emerge and join the ranks of Python and R. Maybe. We’ll see. “An open-source, JavaScript library providing high performance, intuitive, and easy to use data structures for manipulating and processing structured data.”

## Reflective Democracy Campaign: “Less of the Old Boys’ Club” ⚖️

Reflective Democracy published their findings and datasets, which have shown, “a bi-partisan majority of voters [want] more reflective candidates, and less of the Old Boys’ Club.” It also includes some interesting infographics.

## Announcing the Consortium for Python Data API Standards 🤝

With the advent of a multitude of Python data science, statistics, and machine learning libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, etc., this recently formed consortium of organizations and library maintainers are attempting to standardize the API for the various libraries.
