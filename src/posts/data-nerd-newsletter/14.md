## 6 lessons-learned to get ready for the next wave of COVID ü¶†

This article is a longer read (~17 minutes), but incredibly insightful. DJ Patil was the U.S. Chief Data Scientist during the Obama administration and is currently volunteering to help California‚Äôs COVID efforts. He outlines some sensible suggestions and cautionary tales as we continue through the pandemic. And remember, we‚Äôre still in the first wave.

## Interactive Exploration of COVID-19 data + County Data üìä

A connection on LinkedIn (and fellow Springboarder!) made me aware of this set of interactive data visualizations put together by Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois. Using the Johns Hopkins dataset you can drill down even further than some of the other interactions I‚Äôve seen.

## Feel the Love with Scrum for Data Science üï¥

As a software developer in my previous life, I love Agile and Scrum. It‚Äôs a great way to communicate with your team and stay motivated as you iterate on things. Eugene Yan goes through his Scrum ‚Äúawakening‚Äù in this 10-minute post and what it could mean for other data science teams.

## Free Data Science Books via Springer üìö

Free is fantastic, and knowledge is power. So be fantastically powerful by checking out these free book offers by Springer. This link will take you to the Math & Statistics section, but there are MANY others to choose from.

## COVID-19 Dashboards

Despite how people are acting, the COVID-19 pandemic is not over and still in the first wave. I‚Äôm going to keep these dashboards readily available so we can track things (and will add the above visualization next issue). Stay safe out there!
