## SBA Loan Dataset üí∞

[Simon Willison](https://github.com/simonw) compiled this dataset of companies that received more than \$150k in Small Business Administration loans. There have been a few other compilations and discoveries, but I find this to be the most basic and accessible. There are even SQL abilities. Search away!

## Choosing Fonts for Your Data Visualization üìä

I'm design-challenged, so I've never been a typography guy. After many conversations and constructive arguments with designers, I can agree that typography and fonts are essential to convey a message quickly and be easier to read and understand. This article takes a deep dive into the types of fonts and how to use them for better data visualizations.

## Pickle Flaws: Don't serialize your model with Pickle until you know about these ü•í

Pickle is a way for data scientists to serialize their model so that it's easily sharable. However, as Ned covers in this article, it's far from perfect. That said, before you reach for another method/app, it's worth understanding the features and limitations of all.

## COVID-19 Dashboards

Things are going to be tough the next month or so while our elected officials finally realize that science is real. I've trimmed down the dashboards to ones I think are most helpful. Wear a mask. Wash your hands. Stay safe out there!

- [Rt.live (Rt = Rate of Transmission)](https://rt.live)
- [Johns Hopkins ArcGIS Dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)
- [COVID-19 Data for Locations of People You Love (i.e. Data by US County)](http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-by-your-locations/)

If you have any other dashboards to share, please send them my way.
