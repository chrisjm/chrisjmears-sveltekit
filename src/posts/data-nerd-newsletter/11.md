## Analysing the (Alleged) Minneapolis Police Department ‚ÄúHack‚Äù

After about 3 years of silence, the hacker group Anonymous is back. Prompted by the murder of George Floyd, they allegedly hacked the Minneapolis Police Department and released around 800 email addresses and passwords. Troy Hunt explains his analysis and why he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a proper ‚Äúhack.‚Äù

## Tutorial: OpenCV Social Distancing Detector

For obvious reasons, social distancing is very popular right now (disclaimer: actual popularity varies depending on location). This tutorial uses OpenCV (CV = Computer Vision) and deep learning to process a video file and determine which people are 6ft apart.
