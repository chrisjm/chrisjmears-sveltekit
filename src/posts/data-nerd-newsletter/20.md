## Learning ML Roadmap 2020 🤖

This extensive Whimsical mind map made by Daniel Bourke organizes the resources you need to know and learn to thrive with machine learning in 2020. He even recorded a 2.5-hour livestream going over each section in more detail.

## Pandera: Data Validation for Pandas 🐼

Working with messy data in Pandas can be frustrating. Pandera uses schemas to validate data based on type and property rules. It can even do more complex statistical validation and hypothesis testing.

## Listen to the soothing sounds of Wikipedia 🔈

This project streams recent changes to Wikipedia and transforms the data into sounds based on the type and size of the update. It’s surprisingly very soothing to listen to while working.
