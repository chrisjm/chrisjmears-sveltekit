## Critiquing a Data Visualization Critique 🤔

This article is a semi-dramatic critique of what seems like an insightful data visualization critique about a Georgian state government’s data visualization. TLDR; We’re entering an age of needing to pay very close attention. And, perhaps more importantly, increase our level of compassion and empathy.

## Streamlit: The fastest way to build custom ML tools 🚀

I’ve seen a couple of examples of using Streamlit to build some apps quickly. I’m always skeptical of “cool new frameworks,” but this one is worth a look. I plan to make some example projects with it in the coming months.

## Tempering Expectations for GPT-3 🤖

If you haven’t kept up with the news, Generative Pretrained Transformer 2, or GPT-2, can construct a believable [sample article about the discovery of unicorns in South America](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#sample1). Some people hailed GPT-3 as being the apex for the singularity (i.e., Skynet and Terminators). Learn why this isn’t the case...yet. (dramatic hamster!)
