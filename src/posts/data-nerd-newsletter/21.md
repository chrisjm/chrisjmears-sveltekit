## USPS study on the continued relevance of physical advertising 📬

While the United States Postal Service is under the attack, it’s worth highlighting a study completed in conjunction with Temple University released in 2019. The analysis describes how direct mail is more memorable and, therefore, still a viable marketing channel. It’s short and worth the read.

> “Not only did participants spend more time with physical ads, they also remembered them more quickly and confidently.”

## The Washington Post releases climate data analysis from “2°C: Beyond the Limit” 🌎

The WaPo released all of their data and analysis from the 2019 Pulitzer-winning series. Always nice to have some high-quality, clean data to create some projects quickly.

## The Data Visualization Catalogue 📊

Despite the number of ads (definitely turn on an ad-blocker, if you have one), this is a great resource on the variety of data visualizations and when to use them. Again, it’s a great resource but, seriously, wear ad-protection.
