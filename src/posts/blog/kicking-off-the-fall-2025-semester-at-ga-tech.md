Today is the first day of the Fall 2025 semester at Georgia Institute of Technology, and the start of my sixth class in the [Online Master of Science in Analytics (OMSA)](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics) program! This semester, I'm taking the last of my foundational courses: [CSE 6242, Data and Visual Analytics](https://poloclub.github.io/cse6242-2025fall-online/).

I'm super excited! This course is known for being a fire-hose of different technologies going from data collection, analysis, to visualization. While I have experience with most of them after my previous fire-hose of a job working for a top-notch healthcare analytics product, I love filling in the gaps, especially when learning from the professors at Georgia Tech who are masters in the field. I'm super stoked to see what this semester has in store and what I'll learn.

Right now, my goal is to get back into the rhythm of daily journaling and sharing what I’m learning and what I know. You can expect to see more posts here, and probably on the [Open Brewery DB blog](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) (if I ever make one, haha) and [Blue Sky](https://bsky.app/profile/chrisjmears.com) as well. It’s time to get out of the cocoon and start putting myself out there again.

Let the learning in public begin!
