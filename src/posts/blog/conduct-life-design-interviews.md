When I decided I needed to make a career change, I panicked a little. What should I do? Should I go back to school? Should I take a boot camp workshop? Should I sell everything and move to remote Alaska with my dog?

Thankfully, my mastermind partner recommended the book **<a href="https://designingyour.life/" target="_blank">_Designing Your Life_</a> by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans** for our weekly goal.

I ordered the book on Audible and did an entire listen at 2x the speed during a long walk with my dog one Sunday afternoon. It blew my mind. I immediately started listening to it again (1.5x this time üòÅ).

The **Prototyping** section was the one that resonated with me the most at the time due to my flailing and complete indecision on what I wanted to do.

I had a shortlist of career paths and roles I was considering, given my strengths and interests. I posted a message on LinkedIn requesting any introductions to those roles and got a good handful of helpful leads.

## What are life design interviews?

The authors, Burnett and Evans, also called life design interviews: prototype interviews, or prototype conversations.

Essentially you are having conversations with people who are currently in your desired role or field to learn more about it. The goal is to learn more about the position, strengths required, and daily activities to determine if it resonates with you.

For example, you don't want to go all the way into owning a restaurant and then learn you absolutely can't stand the daily activities required.

### How do you find people to interview?

The simplest way is to ask friends, family, and your social network.

Additionally, use LinkedIn's search to filter through 2nd network contacts. For more granularity, use with the "Title" field under "All Filters" to search for a specific role.

### Get introductions

Once I posted a note on LinkedIn, many of my contacts were readily willing to make introductions for me.

If you want to streamline the process, you can create a template for them to copy and paste in a message to their friend.

### Make scheduling easy

I like Calendly to schedule times. It can connect with cloud-based calendars such as Google Calendar to only show the times which you are available.

### Be respectful of time

Always be respectful of time. Let them know how long you expect to chat. I found between 15-30 minutes was perfect for getting through introductions, general chit-chat, and then dive into talking about the interviewee's career path.

### It isn't a job interview

While you may be in the market for a job, what you're after is a casual conversation centered around the interviewee's personal story and what their role looks like.

### Keep it casual

Keep it casual, but have a purpose. If it helps, have an outline or script ready so that you tackle everything you want to talk about.

Even if you do forget something, you'll have another chance with a follow-up thank-you note.

### Send a thank you note

It's polite to send a follow-up thank-you notice to thank your interviewee for their time. If you have any follow-up questions or questions you forgot to ask, now is a great time to keep the conversation going. You never know where it may lead.

I hope this was a helpful overview of life design interviews. Have you tried any techniques during your prototyping conversations that have worked well?

It's stressful not knowing what to do with your life, but chances are you have a vast network of people who want to help you make the best decision and find your passion.

## Five Years Later: The Winding Path Continues

It's been over five years since I wrote the first part of this article about conducting life design interviews. Rereading that post today is an interesting experience, and it felt like the right time for a follow-up.

The good news is that most of what I wrote back then still holds true. The process works. But I wanted to add a little more flavor after five years of walking the path that process helped me discover, a path that led me to places I never initially considered or thought I'd revisit.

### The Starting Point: Ruling Things Out

When I first started this process, I had a list of potential job titles that make me chuckle a little now: Customer Success Manager, Technical Support Engineer, Developer Advocate, and Product/Project Manager. The interviews I conducted were invaluable, primarily because they convinced me that **none of these were quite the right fit**.

- _Customer Success Manager & Developer Advocate:_ These roles were a bit too forward-facing. As a supreme introvert, I realized that much direct, constant interaction would drain me and lead to burnout again.
- _Technical Support Engineer:_ This was closer, but it felt like a parallel track to the software engineering path I was already on and wanted, at the time, to get out of. It was too broad and didn't feel like the significant change I was looking for.
- _Product/Project Manager:_ I thought about this or a Technical Project Manager for a bit longer than the rest after the interviews, but quickly realized that it was more of an extrovert's job and countless meetings, and not something I was interested in, yet.

**The real power of these conversations wasn't in finding a "yes," but in confidently reaching a "no."**

### The Pivot: A Nudge from a Friend

The breakthrough came from a couple of friends who, in that wonderful way friends sometimes do, knew me better than I knew myself. They suggested I look into becoming a **Data Analyst**.

My biggest immediate fear was the math. I had gone through Calculus I and 2 in undergrad, but I quickly forgot it after the exam and lack of use throughout the years. I also knew I should never have left it, and wanted to get back into it. So, I took the leap and enrolled in Springboard's Data Science Bootcamp in 2020 (right when the pandemic hit, yay!).

Regarding the bootcamp, I enjoyed the classes, and they put me on the right trajectory. It did not teach me the math, but was a gentle reintroduction into probability and statistics and a researcher's mindset. I knew it was a bootcamp, not a golden ticket to the "fancy data scientist job" I might have been dreaming of, but it gave me the confidence that I could handle the work. I navigated my own job search, so I can't speak to their job guarantee promises, but the curriculum itself was valuable for me.

### The Realization: From Startup Life to a Deeper Calling\*\*

Before I even graduated from the bootcamp, I landed a contract-to-hire, full-time job at a small healthcare analytics startup. That four-year firehose of experience was a crucible, taking me through several different roles and dramatically expanding my knowledge.

It was there that I had two major realizations:

1. I was fully capable of being a Senior Software Engineer.
2. Despite that, what I was truly passionate about was going deeper into data analysis, mathematics, and machine learning.

Just as this conviction was solidifying, the world of large language models exploded, which only accelerated my desire. I knew I wanted to not just use these tools, but to understand how to build them. I had too many "unknown unknowns," and the only way to fill those gaps was to go back to the fundamentals.

The bootcamp was the perfect way to quickly gain practical skills and confirm my interest in the field without the commitment of a full degree. It gave me the confidence to land my first data-heavy role that I wouldn't have been able to do otherwise. However, at my job, I realized that to build the complex machine learning models I was fascinated by, I needed a deeper, foundational understanding of statistics and theory‚Äîthe 'why' behind the 'how'.

### The Next Chapter: Grad School and What's Next

This realization led me to apply to [Georgia Tech's Online Master of Science in Analytics (OMSA)](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics). For the last year, I've been a full-time student, and I'm now about halfway through the program (as of Fall 2025). It has been challenging, rewarding, and has confirmed that I'm on the right path.

### Conclusion: It All Works

So, what's the takeaway five years later? **The process works.** Its most significant strength is in helping you understand not just what you want to do, but what you _definitely do not_ want to do. And that is incredibly valuable.

My original advice stands, and I can't stress it enough:

- **Keep talking to people.** Curiosity is your best tool.
- **Be respectful of their time.** Be quick, be prepared, and be on target with your questions.
- **Always send a thank-you note.**
- **Be grateful.** Someone giving you their time is a gift. In a world where nobody has time, it's a precious commodity.

Thank you for reading, and I hope this helps you build a fulfilling career through curiosity and experimentation!
